## Project Overview

This is a backend project that consists of a simple CRUD application, designed to allow users to search for players in the Fantasy Premier League. 
The application includes a REST API that interacts with a PostgreSQL database, allowing users to query and retrieve player data based on specific criteria (team, position, nationality, etc.).

## Features

- **Search for players**: Users can filter players by team, position, or nationality.
- **Add, update, and delete players**: Full CRUD functionality for managing players.
- **Spring Boot Backend**: Utilizes Spring Boot for creating the REST API.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, with data from a CSV file being migrated into the database.
- **Data Scraping**: The project includes a data scraper that periodically scrapes the latest player data, ensuring that the database is always up to date with the most current player information.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The language used for backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used for building the backend REST API.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database management system used to store player data.
